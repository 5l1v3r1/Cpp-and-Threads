# Cpp-and-Threads
Some examples how C++ multithreading programming works, includes tips and adviced with good approches for achieving good and efficient results.

As a small task was chosen such task:

1. Create an application which calculates prime numbers for intervals:
    
    - Load intervals from specified xml-based file;
    
    - For each interval start standalone thread for calculating prime numbers;
    
    - Each calculation thread must store every calculated prime number to shared container list;
    
    - Save unique prime numbers to xml-based file (primes tag).
    
Example of source xml file:

<root>
 
 <intervals>
   
   <interval>
     
     <low> 100 </low>
     
     <high> 200</high>
   
   </interval>
   
   <interval>
     
     <low> 500</low>
     
     <high> 888</high>
    
    </interval>
	....
  
  </intervals>

</root>

Example of output (may be added to the source xml file):

<root>

<primes> 101 103 107 149 743  751â€¦ </primes>

</root>
